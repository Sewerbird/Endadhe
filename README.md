Javascript necromancer game


Objective: Conquer the Kingdom by terrorizing denizens and corrupting officials, all whilst hiding from the otherwise overwhelming power of the Army and Church.

Initial State: A decentralized kingdom littered with old battlefields, graveyards, fey wilds, and small villages linked by highways. You begin as a necromancer with a home den located in the remote hills.


Very Early Roadmap:

-	Have a canvas that has villagers randomly walking around (wrapping edges: don't care about collision)
-	Have a villager that is controlled by the player
-	Differentiate villagers as good, bad, and neutral. Make the player the 'bad' one
-	Have good villagers chase bad villagers, and neutral villagers run away from bad villagers (all within a detection radius)
-	Allow bad villagers to hide/sneak
-	Allow bad villagers to kill other villagers
-	Create map with movement costs
-	Create town points and make villagers congregate nearby
-	Create roads and make villagers sometimes travel along them to other towns
